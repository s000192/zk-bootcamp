1.  Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
    a)  4 + 4 = 1 mod 7
    b)  3 x 5 = 1 mod 7
    c)    a^{−1} ≡ a^{p−2} (mod p)
        = 3 ^ (7-2) = 3 ^ 5 = 243
        = 5 mod 7


2.  For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, we cannot consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group because:
    Yes it follows all of the group rules

3. -13 mod 5 = 2 mod 5
