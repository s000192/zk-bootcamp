    1. It is true that all odd squares â‰¡ 1 (mod8)
        19 * 19 - 1 = 360 which is divisble by 8
    2. Even square (mod 8) is not true
        6 * 6 = 36 which is not divisble by 8

    1. O(n) means the time taken to solve the problem is relative to n
    2. O(1) means complexity is constant
    3. O(log n) means it is less complex than O(n) but more complex than O(1)

5.
    For SNARKs, proof size complexity is O(1)
    For STARKs, proof size complexity is O(poly-log n)
    For bulletproofs, proof size complexity O(log n)
